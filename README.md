# Statsketball-Tournament

In this project, I scraped online data from Kenpom.com and sports-reference to predict results of 2017 NCAA basketball matches. I used the SVM algorithm with a total of 4 more relevant variables to build the model and the resulting prediction accuracy (percentage of correct predictions) is around 74 percent using cross-validation.

A more detailed discussion on methodology and precedures can be found in the "Paper" folder.
